      summary: Update mapping of sensor ids to students, teachers, materials, and classroom areas
      description: |
        This endpoint is used to create and update mappings of sensors to physical entities, such as students, teachers, materials, or areas. To associate a sensor with a new entity, start_time and end_time should not be specified. The server will end any existing mapping of this sensor. To mark a sensor as not associated with any entity, the entity type and entity id fields should be left blank.
