Once you're in this folder, you can start the visualizations on your local machine! 
This demo folder has the visualizations seen in the UIST paper.

To run them, cd to this folder on your machine and run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`. 

Here are direct links to the five visualizations in the paper, once you're started the server (assuming port 8000):
* <http://localhost:8000/stacked_bar/>
* <http://localhost:8000/region/test/region.html>
* <http://localhost:8000/sankey/sankey.html>
* <http://localhost:8000/lesson/lesson.html>
* <http://localhost:8000/lessons/teacher_radar.html>
